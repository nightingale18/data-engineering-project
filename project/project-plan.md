# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Battle-related deaths during natural resource conflicts in Latin-America from 1946 to 2006

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. What is the procentage of civillians being killed during natural resource conflicts?
2. Top 5 years in which the largest percentage/number of civillians in Latin-America during natual resource conflicts were killed?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
XY is an important problem, because... This projects analyzes XY, using method A. The results can give insights into...
It is important to analyze the consequence of having conflicts on civillians' lives such as deaths. Exploring only a subgroup of the conflicts in Latin-America to natural resource conflicts, I mitigate the area of research. Within this conflicts I would investigate the deaths during battles on this territory to find out the top 5 conflicts with largest percentage of deaths among civillians.
