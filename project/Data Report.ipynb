    "\n",
    "Since both datasets, The Natural Resource Conflict Dataset and UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset version 24.1, belong to The Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), we could look at licences and permission denoted by this organization. At this web page you could find this information: \n",
    "\n",
    "`In the same way as international organizations and international order benefit a small country like Norway, open data policies benefit Norwegian social science – and PRIO in particular...All data collection efforts at PRIO are openly available...` from [3]. This proves that they are under a standard open-data license.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it was included that, in order to use theirs datasets for a non-commercial or research purpose, you need to include the references to these papers, where they were first presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset version 24.1 use the link to the project description website [6]. However, you could also find this information of how to refer to these datasets by downloading an appendix or a cookbook via [1] and [3].\n",

    "1. **Pipeline's structure for a Natural Resource Conflict Dataset**\n",
    "- **Modules**:\n",
    "  - **Extract**: Reads metadata and downloads Stata files.\n",
    "  - **Transform**: Filters rows, removes unnecessary columns, standardize data format, filter manually Latin-America countries, remove empty cells and duplicates, add `years` column from `start_date` and `end_date`.\n",
    "  - **Load**: Stores transformed data in SQLite database as conflicts.sqlite.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Pipeline's structure for UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset version 24.1**  \n",
    " - **Modules**:\n",
    "  - **Extract**: Reads zipped metadata and downloads CSV files.\n",
    "  - **Transform**: Filters rows, removes unnecessary columns, filter automatically Latin-America countries, rename `location_inc` to `location` for a consistency with the first pipeline, remove empty cells and duplicates.\n",
    "  - **Load**: Stores transformed data in SQLite database as deaths.sqlite.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "More information regarding which transformations and cleaning steps were done and why you could find in a previous section `2.2 Structure and Quality of Data Sources`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I encountered with the problems:\n",
    " - when I tried to filter my datasets for Latin-America countries without a region information, which made me to search for the region of the country manually using maps;\n",
    " - when I tried to standardize data format into 'years', 'days', 'months' and 'whole days' from data string type;\n",
    " - to decide which columns are meaningful for my task.\n",
    " \n",
    "Regarding Handling Errors or Changing Input Data, I used:\n",
    "- `prevent_errors` function to remove all empty rows and duplicates using pandas methods: `dropna` and `drop_duplicates`\n",
    "- I changed input data of the dataset 1, which is a datatype string, in order to achieve consistency with the dataset 2. Finally we got a new column `year` to check correspondence with each database.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3. Results and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Results**:\n",
    "  - Datasets stored in SQLite include only Latin-America countries. They were stored in a that way due to necessity of combining 2 different tables, that could be done using foreign keys, e.g. `year` and `location` .\n",
    "  - The datasets are complete by removing empty and duplicates values\n",
    "  - They are consistent in terms of same columns of a `year` and a `location` across both datasets\n",
    "  - They have same timeliness in terms of the `year` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations**:\n",
    "  - Timeliness issue: The dataset 2 [3] does not include the starting and ending dates, but rather `years`. For this reason, we could depend regarding precise days on the data given from the table 1 [1].  \n",
