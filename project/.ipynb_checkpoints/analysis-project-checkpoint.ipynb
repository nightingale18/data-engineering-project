    "## Analysis of Battle-related deaths during natural resource conflicts in Latin-America from 1989 to 2006\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Nowadays, wars are still occurring, with the main reason for invasion being natural resources. Unfortunately, the locals are also affected, which leads to an increasing number of deaths. The aim of this project is to distinguish the most devastating years in which the greatest number of civilians were killed, as well as the countries in Latin America where the most calamitous wars happened from 1989 to 2006. The study also helps to identify the main causes of protracted conflicts over natural resources. The area of research is a Latin America, which is generally understood to include the entire continent of South America, plus Mexico, Central America and the islands of the Caribbean.\n",

    "In Figure 1, the bar chart shows the top 5 most violent opposing groups from 1989 to 2006. However, the most bloody aggressor forces were the ELN and Farc in Colombia, who killed 21586 people in 17 years.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fig 3. Mechanisms over Location and number of killed civilians </div>\n",
    "In Figure 3, the scatter plot shows the mechanisms by which violent natural resource conflicts were affected from 1989 to 2006. Thus, the worst conflicts were in Colombia, where the largest number of civilians killed over 17 years was 21586. It happened due to financing mechanism, where Rebel groups use natural resources to finance rebellion. The second most cruel wars happened in Peru (6482 killed) due to financing mechanism and aggravation mechanism, where natural resource issues aggravate an ongoing conflict. The Third most cruel natural conflict was in El Salvador (5861 killed) due to distribution mechanism, where disagreements arise over distribution of natural resources or revenues. In conclusion, the most common cause of natural conflicts, which leads to enourmous amount of deaths among civilians, was due to financing mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The results derived from this project state that the most devastating conflicts were happened in Colombia due to financing mechanism, where Rebel groups use natural resources to finance rebellion, due to ELN and Farc forces, who killed around 21586 civilians. It is complicated to calculate the amount of killed people by each of the aggressor organisation, because those troops were working in cooperation with another, e.g. 1. ELN and Farc or 2. ELN, EPL-Megateo and Farc.\n",
